# Actor and cut presentation

This pass changes rendering only. The simulation still owns positions, collision radii, capture, enemy behavior and replay results.

The inspected Reloaded reference frames show bright compact bodies, short motion tails, clear centers and thin secured boundaries against black concealment: [Pack 1](research/evidence/round-05/reloaded-pack1-0433.png) and [Pack 6 Level 7](research/evidence/round-06/reloaded-pack6-l7-114.png). A still frame does not establish animation timing or input behavior. The new silhouettes are original procedural pixel drawings, not extracted game artwork.

## Body, motion and scale

[`createActorPresentation`](../game/ui/actor-presentation.mjs) keeps a bounded previous-position cache and cosmetic clocks. Heading follows observed positions on new simulation ticks; `vx/vy` supplies only the initial orientation when available. Walking/treads use movement distance, while rotors and radar can idle. Pause, stun, dormancy and classic enemy freeze stop the relevant pose clocks. Reduced effects retain clear facing without banking, moving trails or capture pulses.

`microtile` reduces fine details; `hybrid` and `props` retain highlights and larger body treatments. New themes with the existing `fpv`, `atlas`, `retro` or `navi` family inherit the matching presentation. The existing eight artwork slots and additional classic `contour`, `rover`, `eroder` slots remain independent replacements. Imported bodies face upward at zero rotation; the renderer rotates them with observed travel. Existing player body/propeller rigs are retained.

The desired normal body footprint is 18–28 CSS pixels on canvases at least 480 CSS pixels wide, and at least 12 on ordinary phone-sized canvases. Logical caps of 48 pixels (60 for bosses) prevent unlimited enlargement on very small embedded canvases. At smaller sizes the cap can take precedence over the desired minimum. `BoardPainter.draw(..., {actorScale})` accepts a bounded cosmetic multiplier; it is not a physics setting or a new persisted player preference.

The player uses its existing animated rig with a separately bounded `playerScale`. Its contained image box targets 24–32 CSS pixels on desktop and at least 16 on ordinary phones, capped at 64 logical pixels. The current drone's transparent source margins make the visible body roughly 18/12 pixels at these minima; arbitrary replacement images can have different margins. Source rectangles are not cropped, so rotor anchors and non-square image proportions stay intact. The neutral fallback uses its visible triangle extent. Shield and queued-turn cues move outside the enlarged body, while the player contact ring stays at the authored `rules.playerRadius`.

The solo Phaser host passes `displayCSSWidth` from its visible game canvas into `BoardPainter.draw`. Its detached texture canvas has no displayed width and cannot supply this measurement. Direct-canvas hosts such as couch and replay theater retain the context canvas's `clientWidth` fallback; an unavailable or invalid measurement falls back to the logical board width. Resizing changes presentation size without changing simulation geometry.

A small center marker and radius outline remain at the simulation contact footprint independently of the larger body. Warning/rejoining brackets, dormant-rover cues, freeze/slow icons and all terrain/pickup roles remain visible. Custom artwork does not remove these functional cues.

## Live cut and capture

The active cut has a dark contrast outline, bright colored body and a narrow light center. Its moving highlight stays on the final short section of the actual line. Enemy tails have at most three nearby points; there is no ambient particle field over hazards.

`cells.claimed` indices are copied into a bounded presentation effect. A brief low-opacity sweep touches those newly safe cells only, with no additional coverage or score. Reduced effects remove this sweep. Paused gameplay does not advance it; terminal victory animation retains its separate pause/lifecycle handling.

## Verification

Run the focused checks:

```sh
node --test game/test/actor-presentation.test.mjs game/test/host-presentation-size.test.mjs game/test/classic-presentation.test.mjs game/test/wide-presentation.test.mjs game/test/rewards.test.mjs game/test/gallery-reduced-effects.test.mjs
```

They check motion/pose clocks, separate contact scale, theme geometry, replaceable role dispatch, bounded history, captured-cell effects and unchanged authoritative checkpoints. Player checks cover four rigs on legacy and wide boards, phone/desktop canvas sizes, independent actor/player scaling, non-square replacement images and intact rotor anchors. Canvas command recording establishes rendering behavior, not visual quality, browser frame rate or physical-device certification. Actual browser play and screenshots remain the visual review gate.

The actual-host sizing test selects the R2 featured chapter through the app, confirms its Daybreak FPV binding, and passes 306/600 CSS-pixel visible widths to a detached texture with `clientWidth=0`. It exercises resizing and demonstrates the old missing-handoff undersizing on that same texture. App, renderer and simulation run normally; Phaser, Canvas2D and image decoding are modeled boundaries, so these measurements establish image-box sizing rather than occupied raster silhouettes.
