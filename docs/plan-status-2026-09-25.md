# Reveal Line delivery status — 26 September 2026

This register is the current source of truth for the player-first delivery programme. It separates
publicly verified releases, accepted source prerequisites, qualification evidence that cannot be
published as-is, and draft work. A merge or successful workflow is not a delivered feature until
its exact cumulative source is frozen, published, admitted to the Pages selector and exercised on
the public site.

## Current boundaries

Draft PR #590 is rebased at `a1d7f215e31c148085143ecf0ff64fb4d7fe3f8f` and waits behind public patch acceptance. |

## Completed and public

- **Default Journey and shared player entry:** ordinary Solo and Versus expose 91 Journey missions;
  Team exposes 12 missions. Explicit Legacy access remains available.
- **Public player shell:** compact Home and Pause, direct mode entry, loading feedback, quick sound,
  global appearance foundations and direct Settings/Help access are present through v0.132.0.
- **Controller/input corrections:** public releases through v0.116.1 removed duplicate controller
  activation in the qualified paths and v0.112.0 removed the unwanted white FPV corner marks.
  This is automated and browser evidence, not physical Steam Deck certification.
- **Rewards and pictures:** v0.116.0 retains the accepted Journey picture and makes earned Solo
  rewards visible in Collection. Team artwork and exact revision-84 picture authority are public
  through v0.131.0.
- **Presentation and content consolidation:** v0.130.0 contains the accepted Ukrainian ornament,
  soundtrack, Journey spatial/pressure and creator-framework work that accumulated after v0.116.1.
  The selector, archive preservation, deployed bytes and ordinary cross-mode entry were verified.
- **Localized cumulative player release:** v0.131.0 is public from immutable product source
  `a63ad4cc`. PR #566 aligns current Team FPV bindings with revision 84 while retaining historical
  revisions 58–83 and keeps Couch continuation cancellation localized and live-switchable. Archive87,
  Pages run 36207322888 and independent public English/Ukrainian Solo, Versus, Team and Legacy Team
  entry checks are complete.
- **Offline/localized cumulative release:** v0.132.0 is publicly selected from exact source
  `109631e70`. Pages run [36214429148](https://github.com/mekhovov/revealline/actions/runs/36214429148)
  passed, the selector names v0.132.0, and both the immutable game route and stable `/app/` launcher
  return 200. Long suites were waived, and physical cold-install/device coverage remains open.

## Qualified evidence only

The compact-gallery merge source `54fbbe52c1622d0e3b0a6a148508b6ea507bdec5` completed exact-source
qualification in run [36187128651](https://github.com/mekhovov/revealline/actions/runs/36187128651).
That result is **evidence only**:

- PR [#535](https://github.com/mekhovov/revealline/pull/535) had merged v0.133.0 before the then-open
  v0.131 and offline product roots.
- PR #544 reverted that merge while preserving all commits and review history.
- The frozen/qualified `54fbbe52` source must not be tagged, selected or published because it
  does not contain the accepted v0.131 root or the now-published cumulative v0.132 root.
- PR [#590](https://github.com/mekhovov/revealline/pull/590) is the corrected draft v0.133.0 candidate at exact head `db44806c2ec4d16873e295a91e87f52b1e3f483a`; both duplicate Couch `activateControl` deltas were removed.
- Its focused/build jobs were cancelled when the higher-priority v0.132.1 fix became active, and release-ready failed as expected for the non-promotable draft. It must rebase after v0.132.1 and run a fresh exact-head gate. The historical `54fbbe52` qualification cannot transfer to a newer head.

Drafts are implementation inputs. Their green focused checks do not authorize merge or public claims
until they are rebased onto the accepted predecessor and pass the exact-head release gates.

## Remaining player-first programme and elapsed ETA

Ranges begin when the item becomes the sole active release candidate. They include ordinary review,
focused correction and one clean release cycle. GitHub runner, large-asset upload and archive delays
can extend them. Hardware-dependent acceptance is called out separately.

The ETA is not a promise that all work can proceed concurrently. Feature preparation may run in
isolated branches, but tags, frozen assets, archive admission and Pages deployment must remain
serialized under one publisher.

## Dependency order and release-slot correction

1. v0.132.0 is immutable and publicly selected from exact source `109631e70`. Keep physical
   cold-install and real-device evidence open without reopening immutable publication.
2. PR #594 exact head `9ab20a966e1493143347601aff991f9fb821c3ac` passed the required
   fast-policy gates and merged via `2f2c90f`; the long suite was skipped, not passed. Publication
   required provenance-ledger PR #600, now merged as `c45cd78bdc522bf95c267615fe3ad93dd77dff98`.
   Complete cumulative publisher qualification, freeze, immutable publication, archive admission,
   Pages and public verification before the gallery advances.
3. Draft PR #590 is rebased onto current main at exact head
   `a1d7f215e31c148085143ecf0ff64fb4d7fe3f8f`: 14 paths, v0.133.0, focused controller and Versus
   optional-case evidence 8/8. Wait for public v0.132.1, then require fresh exact-head CI and its own
   immutable release cycle; historical `54fbbe52` qualification does not transfer.
4. Reconcile PR #549 on top of the publicly accepted gallery so Team quick-start establishes final
   Start/preparation ownership before secondary navigation edits the same host.
5. Reconcile PR #539 on top of quick-start, preserve its safety fix, collapse `relay-rescue.mjs`
   overlap and rerun the interrupted focused checks.
6. Reconcile PR #545 deliberate terminal retry after PR #539; preserve the proven safety patch and
   repeat exact-head Team recovery, Team Skip, Solo self-contact and held-input checks.
7. Reconcile PR #543 contextual Team teaching after terminal-retry ownership; complete real-event
   portrait, short-landscape and reduced-effects browser review.
8. Reconcile PR #552 start/countdown before PR #557 named destinations. Qualify each cumulative
   head from scratch and add campaign-ending plus duplicate-award proof.
9. Carry PRs #542/#548 together in UX5; the test-only fixture must not consume a release slot.
10. Allocate later versions only when each cumulative predecessor is publicly accepted. Do not
    promote by an old draft title or historical version number.
11. Keep creator/admin, bulk campaign and unrelated visual work draft until the player-critical chain
    is accepted. Do not combine unrelated drafts to fill a release.

## Blockers and concerns

1. **Disk pressure:** free space briefly recovered to roughly 6.3 GiB, then fell back to about
   0.6 GiB during parallel release work. Worktree/build expansion is unsafe. Continue exact-path
   plumbing, avoid duplicate builds/artifacts and retire only proven disposable caches.
2. **Temporary long-suite waiver:** full automated matrices are skipped by policy, not green. This
   increases integration risk in the broad localization/offline roots. Restore full CI before UX6
   final qualification.
3. **Physical hardware is not certified:** modeled controller checks and browser pointer clicks do
   not prove Steam Deck, DualSense, iPhone, iPad or tablet behavior. The same applies to 200% zoom,
   safe areas, rotation and reconnect under real device timing.
4. **Human review remains open:** mission fairness, addictive pacing, cultural accuracy, actor
   readability and soundtrack quality require play/listening review and cannot be inferred from
   deterministic tests.
5. **Large cumulative roots:** v0.132 is qualified, immutable and publicly routed, but offline
   installation changes content ownership, storage and lifecycle behavior. Physical cold-install
   coverage remains necessary; a successful public route alone does not certify installed play.
6. **v0.132.1 publisher qualification:** PR #594 passed exact fast-policy gates and merged, but
   publication required the PR #600 provenance-ledger correction. Cumulative source `c45cd78` is now
   in publisher qualification. Long suites remain waived. Corrected gallery PR #590 is rebased but
   cannot promote until v0.132.1 is public and a fresh exact-head gate passes; PRs #549, #539, #545,
   #543, #552/#557 and #542/#548 follow in order.
7. **Release serialization:** only one publisher may own version metadata, tags, frozen assets,
   archive slots and Pages. Parallel implementation cannot make public releases parallel.
8. **Offline footprint:** v0.132 emits 1,298 manifest files / 611,187,354 bytes and a
   611,637,915-byte ZIP. Storage, quota, update peak and optional soundtrack behavior still need
   public and physical-device measurement; retain exact-byte checks for every successor.
9. **Evidence boundary:** the compact-gallery `54fbbe52` qualification is valid historical evidence,
   not a substitute for qualifying the post-v0.132.1 PR #590 cumulative head.
10. **v0.132 public closure:** exact source `109631e70` passed qualification/freeze, independent
    artifact inspection, original upload, immutable publication, archive admission and Pages run
    [36214429148](https://github.com/mekhovov/revealline/actions/runs/36214429148). The selector and
    immutable/stable routes now resolve successfully. Physical cold-install/device coverage remains
    open under the broader hardware caveat and does not change the immutable release record.
11. **v0.131 closure is complete:** the corrected `a63ad4cc` product source passed qualification,
    freeze, artifact inspection and evidence assembly; Archive87 admission, selector merge
    `23e61297`, Pages run 36207322888 and independent public EN/UA cross-mode entry checks passed.
    Physical-device bilingual review remains part of the broader hardware caveat.

## Completion rule

Every player-facing release follows:

**rebase latest publicly accepted predecessor → implement/reconcile related hunks → focused tests and
browser proof → versioned PR → protected merge → exact-source qualification → immutable
freeze/release → predecessor archive → Pages selector/deploy → public byte and scoped-play
verification → status update.**

A branch, passing focused test, merged PR, workflow, tag or deployment is intermediate. “Complete”
means the public version was verified, with waived suites, physical-device limits and human-review
limits stated explicitly.
